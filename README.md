# Sudoku_Solver
This is a program to solve sudokus.

## Example

This implementation uses a backtracking algorithm to fill in the empty cells with valid numbers. The valid() function checks if a given number is valid for a given cell by checking the rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-grid that the cell is in. The find_empty() function returns the next empty cell in the board.
The above code is just an example and you may need to adjust it to suit your specific requirements.

1. Edit the board inside ```sudoku_solver.py```
2. Run ```sudoku_solver.py```
3. Profit.
